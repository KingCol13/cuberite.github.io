Hello all Cuberite fans - it's been about 9 months since the last 
update, so it's about time to let you know the current status of the 
project as well as what's gone on since the last update!

General News
------------

  - Progress for protocol versions greater than 1.12 is still encouraging.
    Connections from 1.13 clients are accepted but not really playable. We're working
    on the needed changes for the new block state format.
    [#5151](https://github.com/cuberite/cuberite/pull/5151)
  - Due to a few changes in the generator it's recommended to regenerate the world
    or update the world.ini file manually to get access to the new features.
